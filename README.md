#Project Description
It is required to develop a program to do operations on polygons data. The program use a defined string format to represent polygons. All polygons will be in one line input. For example:
Polygons=[(1,1),(4,1),(4,5),(1,5);(3,4),(6,4),(6,12),(3,12)]


#Polygons Data
The Polygons line contains a list of polygons data separated by ‘;’. Fields of a Polygon is represented by a set of points separated by ‘,’. The number of polygons are up to 1000 polygon. Each polygon has up to 100 points.
